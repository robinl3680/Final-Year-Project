1. Define Vertex structure that contains.
	1.1 Vertex number
	1.2	Vertex data
	1.3 Adjacency list
	1.4 Local indexing list
2. Intialize MPI environment.
3. For each core do the following.
	3.1 Read the adjacency list
	3.2 Read the partition file
	3.3 Create subgraph on each core
	3.4 Create ghost list on each core
4. Create a local index for vertices on each core.
5. Prepare the ghost vertices for other cores as follows.
	5.1 Pack the ghost vertices for other cores into an array
	5.2 Send the ghost vertices as packed to other cores
6. On the receiving side do the following.
	6.1 Receive the ghost vertices in packed manner
	6.2 Fill the data in the list curresponding to the ghost
	6.3 Send the filled data to the cores from which ghost received
7. Do the required calculations on the cores.
8. Finalize the MPI environment.
