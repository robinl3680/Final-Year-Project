1. Read Mesh file in .su2 format
2. Check the dimension of the input
3. Store the number of vertices
4. For each element in the mesh file do the following
	4.1 Check the type of element
	4.2 Make an element to node mapping
5. From the element to node mapping do the following.
	5.1 Find each face of an element
	5.2 For each face for an element do the following
		5.2.1 If this face is equal to another face of an element then make the face
		as edge and add this pair of elements to adjacency list.
		5.2.2 Store the face information.
6. Write the face information to file.
7. Write the adjacency list to a file.
