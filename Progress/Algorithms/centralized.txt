1. Create a record structure for the vertex that contains
	1.1 Vertex number
	1.2 Vertex data
	1.3 Adjacency list
2. Initialize MPI communication environment
3. Do the following in Core 0.
	3.1 Read the graph file
	3.2 Read the partition file
	3.3 For each partition send the vertex corresponding to that partition
  		one by one
4. For each core other than zero , do the following
	4.1 Construct the subgraph from the vertex sent by the zeroth core
	4.2	Find the ghost vertices from the subgraph
	4.3 Pack together the ghost vertices and send to the zeroth core
5. On the zeroth core do the following
	5.1 find the data corresponding to each ghost vertices sent by each
		other partition
	5.2	send the data to corresponding partition
