1. Read Mesh file in .su2 format
2. Check the dimension of the input
3. Store the number of vertices
4. For each element in the mesh file do the following
	4.1 Check the type of element
	4.2 Make an element to node mapping
	4.3 Make a node to element mapping
5. From the node to element mapping do the following.
	5.1 For each face for an element do the following
		5.1.1 Make an intersection among all the node to element mappings in the
		current face.
		5.1.2 If the cardinality of the resultant set is >= 3 then create adjacency list
6. Write the adjacency list to a file.
